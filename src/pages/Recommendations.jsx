                    "I've had the privilege of working directly under Jeff as my Senior Director DevOps, SRE, DevSecOps at SleepNumber Innovation Labs for nearly five years. During this time, Jeff has consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership, not only in driving our technical vision forward but also in fostering a supportive and high-performing team culture.
                    
                    Jeff is a people-first leader who genuinely cares about the growth and well-being of every team member. He is always approachable, generous with his knowledge, and proactive in providing mentorship and guidance. Thanks to Jeff's support, I've grown significantly both technically and professionally.
                    
                    One of Jeff's standout qualities is his ability to bring people together across different teams and departments. Whether aligning engineering, operations, security, or business stakeholders, Jeff ensures everyone is working toward a common goal. His collaborative approach has broken down silos, encouraged open communication, and resulted in smoother project delivery and greater organizational alignment.
                    
                    Jeff also has a remarkable ability to navigate complex challenges, balancing long-term strategy with day-to-day execution. His vision and organizational influence have been instrumental in driving our DevOps, SRE, and DevSecOps initiatives to new heights.
                    
                    I am grateful for Jeff's leadership and proud to have been part of his team. I highly recommend Jeff to any organization seeking a transformative, inspiring, and collaborative leader."

In that time, I have come to admire Jeff's technical expertise, leadership, and work ethic. On top of these essential qualities, though, his managerial style is probably the best I have encountered. He is able to foster the right level of engagement: never micro-managing, but very alert and able to jump in and provide interventions well-before technical issues or conflicts reach a boiling point. He has an incredible gift for recognizing peoples' strengths and challenging them enough for their work to be rewarding, but never so much that it becomes overwhelming. He is also great at understanding the needs of the larger organization and parsing them into concrete local goals for his team. Lastly and for me, most importantly, one-on-ones with Jeff are an amazing experience. In the space of 30 min. to an hour, we would be able to cover architecture questions, discuss big-picture questions facing the company, and still have a chance to focus on career and personal growth. After each one-on-one, I'd come away with a better sense of how to collaborate most effectively with my coworkers, how to effectively manage my time, how to be more effective in meetings, etc. etc. Working with Jeff has been a high point of my career and I would jump at the opportunity to work with him again!"
